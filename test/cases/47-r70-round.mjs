// r70 round (owner's list after testing r69). Eleven items confirmed fixed;
// item 4 came back "not fixed" a second time; five are new (12–16).
//
//   13. send/sending/sent + reply: "reply massage send korle first a normal
//       vabe jai tarpor reply massage hisabe jai" — the optimistic echo never
//       carried the quote, so the bubble was born unquoted and BECAME a reply
//       when the server row replaced it. One `replyId` per send, written to
//       the payload AND the echo, for text, photo and file alike (a photo /
//       clip / document reply used to drop the quote entirely and leave the
//       quote bar open behind it).
//   4. the mirrored reaction's animation + buzz (see the second half of this
//       file once the r70 gate lands).
//
// No Android SDK here, so the app half is pinned as source shape; CI's apk job
// (testDebugUnitTest lintDebug) is the compile witness.
